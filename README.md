## About me

I have been a fierce Apple consumer ever since the first iPhone came out. As a creativity-driven person, being able to develop solutions that I carry on the palm of my hand was (and still is) breathtakingly exciting. And that's what I'm always doing... even on my spare time, developing apps just feels amazing.

I was blessed with the opportunity to develop great solutions for some incredible and big companies, ranging from working at the Spanish Multinational company, everis (now NTT Data), building a PDF generation (with PDFKit) transactions customization and filtering system (of the client's bank statement) for the Ita√∫ app (largest Bank in Latin America) to implementing same day delivery and local pick up features for the Petlove app (Brazil greatest Pet Ecosystem).
