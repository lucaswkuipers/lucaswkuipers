# Hello, world! 🌎
#### I'm Lucas Werner Kuipers and it's a great pleasure to meet you.

- 📱 I'm currently working on native iOS development (Swift | Objective-C).
- 🎮 I love to play and (most of all) develop physics-based coop / local / couch games (resembling: [A Gummy's Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/585190/A_Gummys_Life/), [Gang Beasts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285900/Gang_Beasts/), [Human Fall Flat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/Human_Fall_Flat/), [Moving Out](https://store.steampowered.com/app/996770/Moving_Out/), [Overcooked](https://store.steampowered.com/app/448510/Overcooked/)...).
- 💬 English (🇺🇸) and portuguese (🇧🇷) are my two main spoken languages.
- 🙋‍♂️ Let's talk! Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaskuipers/).
